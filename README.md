# Language-Classification-with-Naive-Bayes-in-Python

1. Clean and preprocess data for language classification

2. Train and assess a Multinomial Naive Bayes Model 

3. Use subword units to counteract the effects of class imbalance in language classification



**Project Implementation and Takeaways --**


1. Exploratory data analysis of raw data, as well as some basic visualization

2. Data cleaning and preprocessing relevant for task

3. Theory behind and training of a Multinomial Naive Bayes Model

4. Making adjustments to model to take into account class imbalance using theory behind Naive Bayes

5. Using subword units to further counteract class imbalance and improve model performance
